====
[ ] More indepth messages taking into account surroundings... e.g. the forrest thins out, mountains in your distant northwest
  [ ] Look at 9 surrounding tiles and if "mountain, ocean, dungeon/ruins, path" mention "e..g ocean reaching to your south" or path continues north
  [ ] Changing between tile types e.g. forrest thins/abruptly ends reavelling an open plain
[ ] Restrict world e.g. forrest becomes too dense, machete to proceed further, ocean blocking your path, locked door to dungeon
[ ] Implement a path from the beginning cabin to dungeon (perhaps obstacles along the way)
[ ] Implement the interiors of buildings/ruins etc... 
  [ ] Dungeon-style procedural generation
  [ ] Localised map that must be found
[ ] Inventory 
  [ ] Crafting : "combine wood and string"
[ ] Implement ruins with monsters and loot

PATH GENERATION
===============
start = x1, y1  dungeon = x2, y2
(1,3) and (5,0)
breadth first search:
- create a queue and append starting cell:
while queue 
  - pop beginning of queue and store as current cell
  - if current cell = goal break from loop
  - for each neighbour 
    - if neighbour is a valid path cell that has not been visisited (within x and y bounds, not visited, is walkable) 
      - mark as visited
      - append neighbour to queue 
      - parent[new (neighbour)] = current cell  
- traceback:
  - path = [] current cell = goal
  - while current cell != start:
    - path.append current cell
    - current_cell = parent[current cell]
  - path.append start
  - reverse path order

  - PATH FOUND? length of path > 0

you remain in a densely forrested region
